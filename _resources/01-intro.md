Naming is hard. 

Names, after all, are perhaps the most
indelible artifacts of the product creation process. Brands
are redesigned with regularity and codebases are
continually rewritten and replaced but a name,
for better or worse, usually sticks.

That’s because a good name is a hook that sets itself into a person's mind,
linking their brain back to your idea – try to reset the hook and you
risk losing the connection. The process of naming, then, is the process
of neatly packaging up that idea, discovering where it begins and ends 
so it can be linked as a discrete, easily remembered concept.

A good name can help a company or product become successful, of
course, but it can also help the lowliest code library find an
audience, help formalize an informal process, and propel
ideas about the world toward becoming talking points throughout it.

And yet, what tools do we use for naming? What methodology? Many
of us practice it informally, doing our best with thesauruses and
domain name searches, never stopping to formalize an approach because
it seems so devilishly simple – all you really need is a word or two
in a language you’ve probably been using your entire life.

But like any art form, naming benefits from rich tools and
processes, and this site is meant to help you discover them – to
provide a starting point for anyone who needs to name
something. That is: everyone, because every idea benefits from a good
name.

If you find the site useful, consider joining our mailing list below
where we’ll send occasional thoughts and additional
resources on naming. And if you need support on your upcoming naming
project, drop us a line and we'd be happy to help.
